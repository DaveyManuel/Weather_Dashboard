## Description

In this project, I have built a simple weather application that takes in user input within a form field. Said user can input the city of their choice and be shown the current weather for that city at the present moment, and a future 5 day forecast of the weather that will show. The city searched will be saved to the user's local storage and will appear whenever they type into the form field. Included in the results of the search are the general weather conditions, current temperature, highs and lows of the day, how the temperature feels like, humidity, wind speed, and UVI index whose color changes based on if the UVI index is low, moderate, or high.

## UserStory
As a user, I want a a weather dashboard with form inputs so that when I search for a city, I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history

As a user, when I view current weather conditions for a specific city, then I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index

As a user, when I view the UV index, then I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe

As a user, when I view future weather conditions for that city, then I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity

As a user, when I click on a city in the search history, then I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

As a user, when I view the forecast for any day, then I am presented the forecasted weather and a matching background for Clear Skies, Thunderstorms, Rain, Drizzle, Clouds, and Snow.

## Motivation

The motivation for this project was to create a weather forecast dashboard application that was simple and to the point, easy to use, and pleasurable to view.
